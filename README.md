conclusion:Above plot showcases the forecasted revenue from the ARIMA model in 'Yellow'. As you can see, our forecast was able to capture the trend but did not capture the level. This is due to the dataset being small and also the fact that between weeks 51-55, a lot of volatility seems to be present in the sales. This might be due to sales waning after the festive period. We need more data to model this volatility and make our forecast more accurate.
